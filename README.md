# Cyber_Security-Lab

## Objective
1) Design and Deploy a Secure Test Environment
  - Learn to set up virtual machines and networks in an isolated lab.
  - Practice safe experimentation with security tools without impacting real systems.

2) Understand Common Attack Vectors
  - Simulate real-world attacks to observe their impact and behavior.
  - Gain insight into tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.

3) Evaluate and Harden Systems
  - Identify and fix security weaknesses in different operating systems.
  - Test and apply security best practices and configurations.

4) Experiment with Security Tools and Techniques
  - Explore and master tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and Snort.


### Skills Learned
Network and Systems Configuration
  - Setting up virtual networks (using VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V).
  - Installing and configuring Windows and Linux operating systems.

Vulnerability Assessment
  - Scanning systems with tools like OpenVAS, Nessus, and Nikto.
  - Analyzing and interpreting vulnerability scan results.

Penetration Testing Basics
  - Performing reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities.
  - Practicing ethical hacking techniques in a legal environment.

Security Monitoring and Analysis
  - Using IDS/IPS systems like Snort or Suricata.
  - Collecting and analyzing logs using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk.

Digital Forensics
  - Capturing memory and disk images.
  - Performing basic forensic analysis on compromised systems.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Active Directory: A directory service used for managing and organizing network 
resources, users, and permissions in a Windows environment.

- Wazuh: An open-source security monitoring platform that provides intrusion detection, log 
analysis, vulnerability detection, and compliance reporting.

- Postfix: A popular open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) used for sending and receiving email 
on Unix-like operating systems.

- Evil-WinRM: A powerful Ruby-based Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client used by 
penetration testers to connect to and interact with Windows systems, often for post
exploitation tasks such as command execution and data extraction.

- Hydra: A fast and flexible password-cracking tool designed to perform brute-force and 
dictionary-based attacks on various network protocols, including SSH, HTTP, FTP, and more.

- SecLists: A comprehensive collection of penetration testing resources, including wordlists for 
usernames, passwords, web directories, and other payloads used in reconnaissance and 
exploitation phases.

- NetExec: A network exploitation tool that enables remote command execution on target 
machines through various protocols, assisting in lateral movement and privilege escalation 
scenarios.

- XFreeRDP: An open-source implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), enabling 
penetration testers to connect to and control Windows systems remotely for reconnaissance 
and post-exploitation purposes.
